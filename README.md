Project Overview
========

This project is a simply shopping website that retrieves store items and populates them to the user. The user can then select if they want the item and how may they want. 

The biggest thing was to practice using the React Testing Library instead of standard Jest testing. On top of that, I practiced using React routers to tab through various sections of the website.
